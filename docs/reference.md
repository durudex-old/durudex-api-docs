## Authentication

Authentication is performed using the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN`.

**Example Bearer Token Authorization Header:**

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer you-access-token"
}
```

## Refresh Token

This token is generated when a new session is added, and is used to update the lifetime of the `access` token.
Please keep it in a safe place and do not show it to others, it may compromise the security of your account.

| 27 chars | KSUID  | Session Id.    |
| 27 chars | KSUID  | User Id.       |
