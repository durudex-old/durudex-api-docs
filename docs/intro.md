## Authentication

Authentication is performed using the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN`.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer you-access-token"
}
```

## Refresh Token

This token is generated when a new session is added, and is used to update the lifetime of the `access` token.
Please keep it in a safe place and do not show it to others, it may compromise the security of your account.

**Refresh token consists of:**

| Part | Length   | Type   | Value          |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |:-------------: |
| 1    | 27 chars | KSUID  | Session Id.    |
| 2    | 27 chars | KSUID  | User Id.       |
| 3    | 33 chars | String | Token payload. |

> Note: Each part of the token is separated by a point.
